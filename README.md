## 🚀 Features

An innovative educational tool designed to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of AI-generated academic content. This application serves as both a scientific paper generator and an AI detection system, providing users with hands-on experience in understanding artificial intelligence in academic writing.- **AI Paper Generator**: Creates plausible, but fabricated, scientific papers with sections like title, abstract, introduction, and fake dataset metrics.  

- **AI Detection Simulator**: Analyzes text for signs of AI-generated content, providing a probability score, confidence level, and a list of suspicious elements.  

- **Educational Focus**: Designed to raise awareness about academic fraud and digital literacy, with “detection hints” to guide users on spotting AI-generated text.  

- **Fully Client-Side**: Runs entirely in the browser using simulated JavaScript logic (no backend required).  


## 🌟 Introduction

In today's digital age, the rise of AI-powered content generation has created new challenges in academic integrity. The **Scientific Paper Generator & Detector** is an educational prototype that helps users understand how AI-generated academic content works and how to identify it. This tool provides a safe environment to explore the boundaries between human and artificial intelligence in academic writing.
